#X text 440 8 This is a Pure Data patch allowing musicians (or others)
to make point-to-point \, uncompressed \, low-latency audio connections
\, through home routers \, between their computers. It's best if you
can run an ethernet cable from your computer to your router \, but
this will work over "wifi" (wireless networks) too.;
#X text 440 103 To make a call \, enter a unique "call name" (click
on the text area that says "this-call-name" and type in a new name)
\, then click "ON/OFF so that an "X" appears. When someone else makes
a call with the same name \, quacktrip should connect you together
in a call. A public "conniption" server (by default foo.ucsd.edu) helps
make the connection but the audio runs straight between the two computers.
;
#X text 439 383 You can also change the number of channels and/or the
block size of the audio you send to the other site. Click "2X" to send
each outgoing packet twice (this doubles the data rate but might give
fewer dropped packets).;
#X text 440 219 If the "calling" button is flashing we're either waiting
for a response from the server \, or from the peer. Once both of these
arrive the "connected" toggle turns on (gets an "x" mark.) At this
point a call is in progress and the "packets in" counter should be
changing. Press the "reset" button to set packet and drop counts back
to zero.;
